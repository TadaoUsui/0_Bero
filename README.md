## Code and scripts
The repo contains:
- MATLAB script for the visualization of Genome-wide association analysis. All GWAS results in txt files are provided.
- MATLAB script for Heat Probe Assay data analysis and visualization. An example excel file (Example.xlsx) is provided.
- MATLAB scripts for Optogenetic behavioral assay data analysis and visualization.
  - A support vector machine (SVM)-based custom program which perform the automatic analysis. See README file in the folder.
  - A scirpt for maunal analysis. RUN Optogenetic_DataAnalysis. The excel file (ABLK_SELK_opto_activation_sum.xlsx) is provided.
- MATLAB scripts and Jupyter Notebook scripts for Calcium imaging data analysis and visualization.

It also contains:
